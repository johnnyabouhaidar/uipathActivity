# uipathActivity
custom date picker activity for UiPath
hi!
this project generates a .dll file that can be used in nuget package explorer to convert it to a .nupkg file
<b><i>NOTE: the name in the package explorer should contain the word "Activities" in order for the package to be opened in UiPath, this is very important</i></b>

in case you weren't able to convert the file, email me at johnnyabuhaydar@gmail.com to provide you with it
